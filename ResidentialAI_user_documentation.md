## 📱 **app.py - User Interface & Application Logic**

The `app.py` file serves as the main application interface, handling user interactions, authentication, and coordinating with the AI engine.

### **🔐 Authentication System**
**Location:** Lines 50-200

```python
# What it does:
- Validates tester credentials from Streamlit secrets
- Manages 2-hour session timeouts
- Logs user activity for improvement tracking
- Provides secure access to beta testers

# Key functions:
- validate_and_authenticate() - Checks login credentials
- check_session_valid() - Monitors session expiry
- show_login_interface() - Displays login form
```

**How it works:** Users enter Tester ID and Access Code → System validates against stored credentials → Creates authenticated session → Tracks activity for 2-hour duration.

### **⚙️ Environment Setup**
**Location:** Lines 200-250

```python
# What it does:
- Configures API keys from Streamlit secrets
- Sets up Google/OpenAI authentication
- Suppresses verbose logging for clean output
- Handles SQLite3 compatibility for deployment

# Key functions:
- setup_environment_variables() - Loads API keys
- setup_sqlite_with_clean_logging() - Database compatibility
```

**How it works:** App loads secrets → Configures AI model access → Sets environment variables → Prepares system for RAG initialization.

### **🧠 RAG System Integration**
**Location:** Lines 250-300

```python
# What it does:
- Initializes the AI engine (RAG system)
- Handles system startup errors gracefully
- Caches the system for performance
- Manages asyncio compatibility

# Key functions:
- initialize_rag_system() - Starts AI engine
- @st.cache_resource - Prevents re-initialization
```

**How it works:** App starts → Loads RAG system once → Caches for session → All queries use same instance for speed.

### **⚡ Performance Mode Selector**
**Location:** Lines 300-350

```python
# What it does:
- Provides user control over response speed/quality
- Shows expected response times
- Manages performance preferences
- Updates RAG system settings

# Performance modes:
- Fast: 2-4 documents, ~5s response
- Balanced: 3-7 documents, ~8s response

- Food safety analysis
- Wellbeing space evaluation
```

**How it works:** User uploads image → Selects analysis focus → RAG system processes with AI vision → Returns detailed compliance assessment.

### **📊 Session Management**
**Location:** Lines 650-750

```python
# What it does:
- Tracks user activity and performance
- Displays session statistics
- Manages conversation history
- Handles feedback collection

# Monitoring:

## 🔄 **How The Systems Work Together**

### **1. System Startup**
```
app.py starts → Loads environment → Initializes rag_system.py → Ready for users
```

### **2. User Query Flow**
```
User asks question in app.py
         ↓
app.py calls rag_system.query_with_performance_mode()
         ↓
rag_system analyzes complexity and retrieves documents
         ↓
AI generates response with selected model
         ↓
rag_system returns formatted response + metadata
         ↓
app.py displays result with performance stats
```

### **3. Performance Optimization**
```
User selects performance mode → app.py stores preference → rag_system adjusts:
- Fast: Fewer documents, quicker processing
- Balanced: Medium documents, good balance  
- Comprehensive: More documents, thorough analysis
```

### **4. File Upload Flow**
```
User uploads PDF in app.py
         ↓
app.py sends to rag_system.process_uploaded_file()
         ↓
rag_system extracts and indexes content
         ↓
Creates combined knowledge base (main + uploaded)
         ↓
Future queries search both sources
```

### **5. Performance Monitoring**
```
Every query tracked in rag_system → Performance data collected → app.py displays in sidebar:
- Response times
- Cache efficiency  
- Query counts
- System health
```
