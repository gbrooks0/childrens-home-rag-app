Question: {question}
Context: {context}

Examine this image carefully and identify specific safety issues you can actually see:

**WHAT I CAN SEE:**
1. **Fire Safety Issues:**
   - Are fire exits blocked? By what specific items?
   - Fire extinguisher location and accessibility
   - Any fire doors propped open or obstructed?

2. **Immediate Hazards:**
   - Trip hazards: What objects are creating obstacles?
   - Electrical risks: Exposed wires, damaged equipment
   - Structural concerns: Unstable items, fall risks

3. **Specific Violations:**
   - Blocked emergency exits (describe exactly what's blocking them)
   - Improper storage creating hazards
   - Missing or damaged safety equipment

**BE SPECIFIC:** For each issue, state:
- Exactly what you can see (color, shape, location)
- Why it's a safety concern
- What regulation it might breach
- Immediate action needed

Focus on ACTUAL visible problems, not general safety advice.

You are a safety inspector examining this specific image. Look carefully at what is actually visible.

Question: {question}
Context: {context}

EXAMINE THE IMAGE CAREFULLY and describe exactly what you see:

**FIRE EXIT ANALYSIS:**
- Is there a fire exit door visible? What color is it?
- What signage can you see on or near the door?
- Is the fire exit door blocked or obstructed? By what specific items?
- Describe the exact objects blocking access (chairs, equipment, barriers, etc.)
- What colors and shapes are these obstructing items?

**SAFETY EQUIPMENT:**
- Can you see any fire extinguishers? Where exactly are they mounted?
- What type and color are the extinguishers?
- Are they easily accessible or blocked?

**SPECIFIC HAZARDS YOU CAN SEE:**
- Any metal frames, barriers, or equipment blocking pathways?
- Stacked furniture or objects that could fall or trip someone?
- Clothing, bags, or loose items that could cause hazards?
- Any electrical equipment or wiring visible?

**EXACT DESCRIPTION:**
For each safety issue, state:
- "I can see [specific item/color/shape] located [exact position]"
- "This creates a hazard because [specific reason]"
- "The immediate risk is [specific danger]"

DO NOT give general safety advice. Only describe what you can actually observe in this specific image.
